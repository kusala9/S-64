MOVEMENT OF SHIPPING

Vessels navigating in the approaches to Milford Haven should do so with extreme 
caution as deep-draught vessels with limited manoeuvrability may be encountered. 
Passing vessels are advised to keep at least 5 miles off Middle Channel Rocks 
Lighthouse (51°40´.31N, 5°09´.83W). Alternatively, contact Milford Haven Port 
Control to obtain information on movement of shipping in and out of the Port of 
Milford Haven.
