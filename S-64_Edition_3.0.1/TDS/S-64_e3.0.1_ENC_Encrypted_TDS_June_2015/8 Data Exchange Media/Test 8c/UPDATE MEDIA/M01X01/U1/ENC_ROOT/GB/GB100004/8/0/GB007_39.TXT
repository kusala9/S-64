PIPELINES

Mariners are advised not to anchor or trawl in the vicinity of
pipelines. Pipelines are not always buried and their presence may
effectively reduce the charted depth by up to 2 metres. They may
also span seabed undulations and cause fishing gear to become
irrecoverably snagged, putting a vessel in severe danger.
