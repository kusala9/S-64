DESIGNATED ANCHORAGE AREAS

Vessels requiring to wait at anchor must do so only in
the designated anchorage areas. Within these areas,
mariners are requested to occupy the anchor berths
shown. Vessels may not anchor in a fairway except in an
emergency or for the purpose of manoeuvring. For further
details see Admiralty Sailing Directions.
