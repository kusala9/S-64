ANCHORAGE

Vessels wishing to anchor in Milford Haven are required to obtain advice on 
location from Milford Haven Port Control. Deep-draught vessels (over 12 metres) 
are advised not to anchor within a radius of 5 miles from Middle Channel Rocks 
Lighthouse (51°40´.31N, 5°09´.83W). Dale Roads (51°42´.21N, 5°07´.00W) is the 
only anchorage for ships over 7 metres and under 12 metres draught. Mariners 
should take care not to anchor so as to obstruct the Great and Little Castle 
Head leading lights (039.7°). See Admiralty Sailing Directions for details.
