DEPTHS AND AIDS TO NAVIGATION

The channels and depths in this area are subject to frequent change. The buoyage
and other aids to navigation are adjusted accordingly. Buoyed channels and
anchorages are surveyed regularly but this activity can be less frequent over
adjoining sandbanks which are subject to continual change. Passages over
sandbanks should only be used with extreme caution as depths less than charted
may exist. For the latest information, consult the London VTS and the Medway Port
Authority within the Medway Approach Area.
