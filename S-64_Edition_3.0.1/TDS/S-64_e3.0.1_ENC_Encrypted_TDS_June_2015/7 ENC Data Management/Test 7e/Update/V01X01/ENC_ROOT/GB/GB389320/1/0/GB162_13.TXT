CURRENTS

In the vicinity of Glover Reef (16° 50´N, 87° 50´W) currents with rates up
to 2 knots may be experienced. These generally set directly across the
barrier reefs. In Inner Channel a south flowing current is usually experienced
which may attain a rate of over 1 knot following northerly winds or heavy
rain. For further information see Admiralty Sailing Directions.
