AREA TO BE AVOIDED

Mariners are warned to navigate with extreme care in the approaches to Bermuda
due to the extensive and dangerous fringing reefs. In order to reduce the risk
of stranding, an IMO-adopted Area To Be Avoided has been established covering
the northern coast of the islands and the offshore reefs. All vessels carrying
cargoes of oil or hazardous materials and all other vessels over 1,000 grt
should avoid this area. See Admiralty Sailing Directions for details of limits. 
The only safe approach to the islands is from the south-east, preferably in
daylight.
