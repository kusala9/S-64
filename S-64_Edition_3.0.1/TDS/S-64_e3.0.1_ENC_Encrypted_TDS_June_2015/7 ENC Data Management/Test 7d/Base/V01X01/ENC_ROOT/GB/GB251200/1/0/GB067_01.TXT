FORMER MINED AREA

This area is a former mined area in which mines could still present a hazard. 
Anchoring, fishing or seabed operations are not recommended anywhere within this 
area. However, where anchoring is necessary it should be carried out only within 
the designated anchorage areas, as directed by the local authority. 
Additionally, drifting mines may be encountered anywhere in this region. For 
further details, see Admiralty Sailing Directions and Annual Notice to Mariners 
No 6.
