PRIMAR DISCLAIMER TEXT

PRIMAR has made all reasonable efforts to ensure that ENC data contained in the service supplied under this agreement is accurate. The ENC data is supplied by national Hydrographic Offices, which are responsible for the accuracy of their own chart information. 
Moreover, PRIMAR shall not be liable (except in case of death or personal injury solely and directly attributable to any negligent compilation or transcription by PRIMAR) in contract, tort, under statute or otherwise.

The ENCs contained in the PRIMAR service meet SOLAS chart and carriage requirements when kept up to date and used on an ECDIS with suitable backup.



DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ECDIS

Considerable progress has been made in the development of Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), the navigational systems which make use of ENC data.  Many are being developed and a number have now achieved type approval.  Mariners should be aware of the significant changes in navigational practice required by the introduction of ECDIS, and of the need to manage these changes in a careful and prudent manner.  It should also be noted that the appearance and content of the data displayed in electronic charts may differ substantially from the same or similar data in the paper chart form.

Because of the developing nature of ECDIS and because there is as yet only limited ENC data availability, there has so far been little experience of the practical, operational use of ECDIS.  Mariners must therefore be aware of the user training requirement.  They should satisfy themselves that their ECDIS provides all the navigational functionality that they will need, and that they are familiar with the operation of this functionality.  For example, some early ECDIS systems may be unable to display the cautionary notes which appear on the paper chart and are included in the ENC.  Hence, care is required while experience is gained in the practical use of ECDIS.  Some national maritime administrations have issued advice relating to the introduction of ECDIS, and mariners should ensure that they are aware of, and conversant with, that advice.

ECDIS information (Updated 23/11/10)

Mariners using ECDIS are reminded not to rely solely on automated voyage planning and monitoring checks and alarms. Recent preliminary investigation indicates that some ECDIS may not display certain combinations of chart features and attributes correctly and on rare occasions may fail to display a navigationally significant feature. Mariners should always undertake careful visual inspection of the entire planned route using the "other / all" display mode to confirm that it, and any deviations from it, is clear of dangers. 

HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICES´ INFORMATION


AU (Australia) - Updated 13/04/12


UPDATES

Updates for Australian ENCs are issued in line with the fortnightly Australian Notices to Mariners publication.  ENC updates are issued for all relevant Permanent, Temporary and Preliminary Notices to Mariners.  For further information regarding the paper chart equivalent to ENC updates, mariners should consult the fortnightly Australian Notices to Mariners available via the AHS website at www.hydro.gov.au or register online at the AHS website to receive eNotices, an email Notices to Mariners service.

 
DATA APPEARANCE

It should be noted that the appearance and content of Australian ENCS may differ substantially from the same or similar data in the paper chart form.  In particular the compulsory pilotage routes in the Great Barrier Reef contain depth data at 1-metre contour intervals taken from original surveys rather than from the existing paper charts. This will enable the full benefits of ECDIS and particularly its safety depth alarm function to be used most effectively.

 
IMPORTANT NOTICE

Australian ENCs include all significant hydrographic information obtained by the Australian Hydrographic Service (AHS) at date of compilation.  Significant information is updated by Australian Notices to Mariners.  All reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information, including third party information, incorporated in this product.  The AHS regards third parties from which it receives information as reliable, however the AHS cannot verify all such information and errors may therefore exist.  Where possible, indications regarding the reliability of information are noted or symbolised in the product. Users should familiarise themselves with the meaning of any notes or symbols.  The AHS does not accept liability for errors in third party information or the inappropriate use of Australian ENCs.

According to the SOLAS convention (IMO Marine Safety Committee Resolution 99(73) which came 
into force July 1st 2002) this official Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) produced by the Finnish 
Maritime Administration (FMA) can be used as a primary chart when there are no larger scale chart 
data available and the mariner is using a type approved ECDIS system.

This ENC is based on paper charts and is published by the FMA. There are several ENC?s available for 
the Finnish coast. For the latest ENC coverage of Finnish waters, please contact your local ENC 
distributor.

Paper charts on a scale of 1:50000 are available for the Finnish coast. Additionally there are larger scale 
paper charts available for most important ports (Hamina (Finnish chart # 134), Kotka (# 138), Helsinki 
(# 191), Hanko (# 136), Turku (# 190), Maarianhamina (# 160), Degerby (# 169) and Mäntyluoto (#

Importance notice about the Saimaa deep-water route

The maximum authorised draught in the Saimaa deep-water route is 4.35m. According to IHO standard S-57, which determines the data content and technical implementation of ENC cells, the depth of a channel can be expressed with one decimal digit only. Therefore ENC cells show the maximum authorised draught of the route as 4.3m although the actual draught is 4.35m.
For further information on the Saimaa area channels and their depths please contact the Finnish Maritime Administration.

GB(Great Britain) - Updated 27/07/11

ELECTRONIC NAVIGATIONAL CHARTS - Cautionary guidance on the use and 
limitations of ENCs and associated ECDIS systems.

Attention is drawn to the statement in Chapter 1, sections 1.1 and 1.2 of 
The Mariners Handbook (NP100) concerning the use of navigational 
information provided by the UKHO. This includes the following caution which 
applies to all charts, paper and electronic:

     While the UKHO has made all reasonable efforts to ensure the data 
     supplied is accurate, it should be appreciated that the data may 
     not always be complete, up to date or positioned to modern 
     surveying standards and therefore no warranty can be given as to 
     its accuracy. The mariner must be the final judge of the reliance 
     he places on the information given, bearing in mind his particular 
     circumstances, the needs of safe and prudent navigation, local 
     pilotage guidance and the judicious use of available navigational 
     aids.

Updates for UKHO ENCs are issued weekly in line with UKHO policy for all 
its navigational charts, paper and electronic. Due to unforeseen technical 
difficulties, ENC updates may occasionally be issued late and consequently 
may not be synchronised with the corresponding Notices to Mariners and 
updates for paper and ARCS charts. Updates are issued for all Permanent 
Chart-Correcting and Preliminary Notices to Mariners. However, it may not 
always be possible to issue updates for Temporary Notices to Mariners, 
especially those that cover large geographical areas and are not chart 
specific. Mariners should consult the paper weekly Notices to Mariners 
booklet or the UKHO website, www.nms.ukho.gov.uk, for details of these 
Notices to Mariners. 

Considerable progress has been made in the development of Electronic Chart 
Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), the navigational systems which 
make use of ENC data. Many are being developed and a number have now 
achieved type approval. Mariners should be aware of the significant changes 
in navigational practice required by the introduction of ECDIS and of the 
need to manage these changes in a careful and prudent manner.

It should also be noted that the appearance and content of the data 
displayed in electronic charts may differ substantially from the same or 
similar data in the paper chart form. The definition of an ENC permits them 
to include information contained in nautical publications. However, 
currently-available ENCs do not contain such information and mariners using 
ENCs must continue to use related Admiralty nautical publications.

Because of the developing nature of ECDIS and because there is as yet only 
limited ENC data availability, there has so far been little experience of 
the practical, operational use of ECDIS. Mariners must therefore be aware 
of the user training requirement. They should satisfy themselves that their 
ECDIS provides all the navigational functionality that they will need and 
that they are familiar with the operation of this functionality. For 
example, some early ECDIS systems may be unable to display the cautionary 
notes which appear on the paper chart and are included in the ENC. Hence, 
care is required while experience is gained in the practical use of ECDIS. 
Some national maritime administrations have issued advice relating to the 
introduction of ECDIS, and mariners should ensure that they are aware of, 
and conversant with, that advice.

ENCs derived from charts on non-WGS84 compatible datums:

A number of GB cells are derived from charts that cannot accurately be referred to WGS84 Datum. Positions obtained from Global Navigation Satellite Systems, such as GPS, are normally referred to WGS84 Datum. The differences between satellite-derived positions and positions on these cells cannot be accurately determined; the estimated values of the differences for these cells are detailed in the Information attribute of Caution Areas thus: "Positions in this region lie within ± nn metres of WGS84 Datum"

Mariners are warned that these differences MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO NAVIGATION and are therefore advised to confirm GPS positions shown in the chart display using alternative navigational techniques particularly when closing the shore or navigating in the vicinity of dangers.

Such cells contain a warning encoded as the name of a Sea Area feature covering the cell thus "This chart cannot be accurately referenced to WGS84 Datum; see caution message". They are intended for use with this warning continuously displayed and should not be used otherwise.


INTERIM CATEGORY OF ZONE OF CONFIDENCE IN DATA (CATZOC) VALUES:

The boundaries between Quality of Data (M_QUAL) areas with different CATZOC values for certain cells have been taken from the Source Data Diagram (SDD) on the equivalent paper chart and they should therefore be considered to be approximate. Where this is applicable the Information attribute (INFORM) for the M_QUAL area will be set to:

?Zone of Confidence data is taken from charted source data diagrams and so is approximate and simplified. See the README.TXT file contained in the ENC_ROOT folder on any Base or Update CD for further details.?

For these M_QUAL areas, the CATZOC values are based on the simplified summary provided in the SDD and therefore represent the lowest categorisation assigned to any survey in each defined group of surveys.

The degree of simplification also means that it has not been possible to identify minor gaps within survey coverage and mariners should be aware that such gaps (where lower quality survey data has been used in the compilation of the chart) may exist. Adjoining areas within the SDD that require the same CATZOC value have been joined together into a single area.

Note that these assessments are based on original survey accuracies and on expectations of good practice by relevant survey authorities. It is to be expected that some evaluations may require downgrading once detailed survey information has been examined. 


CATEGORY OF ZONE OF CONFIDENCE IN DATA (CATZOC) VALUES - SMALL SCALE CHARTS:

Some ENCs are based on small scale planning charts that do not have a Source Data Diagram. The UKHO has adopted a policy of allocating a CATZOC value of ?D? to all Quality of Data (M_QUAL) areas of such charts though it recognizes that many of these areas are based on higher quality data.

All interim CATZOC values will be replaced by definitive ones in due course.

US (United States of America)

The NOAA electronic navigational chart (NOAA ENC®) files that may be downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are official products. Official ENCs are suitable for navigation under the following regulations and policies, and in the following circumstances:

1. On May 2, 2001, the United States Coast Guard amended the chart carriage regulations to permit government vessels to use electronic charting and navigation systems in lieu of paper charts.

2. On August 15, 2002, the United States Coast Guard issued a statement of policy to bring its regulations into agreement with SOLAS Chapter V (as amended by the changes taking effect July 1, 2002). The policy statement said that, if a ship has an approved ECDIS installed according to SOLAS, Chapter V, the ECDIS will be considered as meeting the ship's nautical chart carriage regulations. The ships that are affected are:

a. U.S.-flagged ships of 150 or more gross tons that engage on international voyages.

b. U.S.-flagged ships certificated solely for service on the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.

c. Foreign-flag ships to which SOLAS, Chapter V, applies that are operating on the navigable waters of the United States. 

This policy is not applicable to U.S.-flag ships engaged only on domestic voyages. These ships must continue to comply with existing navigation equipment requirements until the chart carriage regulations are formally amended.

The NOAA ENC® files available from this site are updated for Notices to Mariners on at least a monthly basis. Users are encouraged to check the site frequently and download the latest versions of the files. Updates are currently available as incremental updates (also called ENC Revision or "ER" files).

Copying, reproduction of the NOAA ENC®s to any other server or location for further reproduction or redistribution is discouraged unless the following guidelines are followed: 1) the NOAA ENC®s and supplementary files including the CATALOG.031 and README.TXT are included in their entirety, 2) this disclaimer is displayed to and accepted by anyone who accesses the NOAA ENC®s, and 3) a reference to this Web site is included so that anyone accessing the NOAA ENC®s is advised of where they originated. 

If these NOAA ENC®s are incorporated into any other product in a form other than as provided by NOAA, the producer of that product assumes full liability and must adhere to conditions 2 and 3 described in the paragraph above concerning copying or reproduction.

ENC overlap in data coverage (Updated 10/12/12):

Some ENCs contain overlapping data coverage which may make them difficult to use in certain ECDIS systems which default to displaying both overlapping cells.  Caution should therefore be exercised when using such overlapping data. Discussions are in hand between the relevant hydrographic offices in order to resolve this overlapping data problem.  In the meantime, there are some areas between the following countries that may contain overlapping data coverage:

GR(Greece) / TR(Turkey)
