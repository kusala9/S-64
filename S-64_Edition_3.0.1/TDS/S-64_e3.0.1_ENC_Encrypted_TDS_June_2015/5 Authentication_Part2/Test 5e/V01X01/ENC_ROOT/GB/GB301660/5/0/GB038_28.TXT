FIRING PRACTICE AREA

Although no restrictions are placed on the right to transit the firing practice 
area at any time, mariners are advised to exercise particular caution whilst in 
the area. Red flags or red lights are displayed to indicate that the area is in 
use. The firing practice area is operated using a clear range procedure. 
Exercises and firing only take place when the area is considered to be clear 
of all shipping. For further details see Annual Notice to Mariners Number 5, 
Byelaws, Practice and Exercise Areas (PEXA) charts, NP(RS) and Admiralty
Sailing Directions.
