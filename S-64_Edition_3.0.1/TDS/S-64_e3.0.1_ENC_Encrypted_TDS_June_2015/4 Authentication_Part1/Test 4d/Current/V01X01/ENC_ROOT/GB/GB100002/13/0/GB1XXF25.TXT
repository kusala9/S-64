BETWEEN THE OFF CASQUETS SCHEME AND THE GREENWICH MERIDIAN

All ships should avoid the charted circular area around EC2 buoy (50° 
12´.0N,001° 12´.5W) leaving it to port. Ships crossing the easterly or westerly 
recommended directions of traffic flow should do so on a heading as nearly as 
practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow. Ships 
joining or leaving the main flow should do so at as small an angle as 
practicable to the recommended directions.
