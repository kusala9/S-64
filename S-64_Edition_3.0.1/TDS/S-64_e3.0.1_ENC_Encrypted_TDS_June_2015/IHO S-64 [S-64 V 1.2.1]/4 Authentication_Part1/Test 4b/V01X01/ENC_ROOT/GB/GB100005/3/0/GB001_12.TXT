PIPELINES

Mariners are advised not to anchor or trawl in the vicinity of pipelines. Gas 
from a damaged oil or gas pipeline could cause an explosion, loss of a vessel's 
buoyancy or other serious hazard. Pipelines are not always buried and their 
presence may effectively reduce the charted depth by as much as 2 metres. They 
may also span seabed undulations and cause fishing gear to become irrecoverably 
snagged, putting a vessel in severe danger. See Annual Notice to Mariners Number 
24 and The Mariner's Handbook.
