DANGER - CHAIN FERRY

Mariners are advised that the water depth varies over the chains, depending on
the state of the tide and the position of the ferry. When the ferry is berthed,
a maximum depth over the chains of approximately 1·7 metres below Chart Datum 
exists in the centre of the fairway. Under certain conditions when the Chain
Ferry is underway, the chains may rise to the surface. Strong tidal flows exist
in this area, the ebb rate being in excess of 3 knots on the eastern side of the
river. Mariners should exercise extreme caution in the vicinity and see Admiralty
Sailing Directions for further details.
