WRECKS

In this area no wrecks are shown within the 10 metre contour. Only significant 
wrecks are shown between the 10 metre and 30 metre contours. In other depth 
areas, only those wrecks thought to stand more than 10 metres above the seabed 
are shown. For full wreck information a more appropriate ENC usage band should 
be consulted.
