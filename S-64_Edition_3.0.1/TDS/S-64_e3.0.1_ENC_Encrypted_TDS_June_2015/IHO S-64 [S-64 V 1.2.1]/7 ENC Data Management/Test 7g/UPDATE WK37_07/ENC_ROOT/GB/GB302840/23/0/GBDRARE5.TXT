DRAUGHT RESTRICTIONS

To reduce the risk to deep-draught vessels resulting from traffic congestion,
passage through the Black Deep and Knock John Channel is normally restricted to
vessels with a draught of over six metres. Vessels with a draught of less than
six metres approaching from the south-east should normally use the Princes
Channel unless access is limited by tidal or weather constraints. In these
circumstances clearance to use the Black Deep/Knock John Channel via Fisherman's
Gat may be sought through London VTS.
