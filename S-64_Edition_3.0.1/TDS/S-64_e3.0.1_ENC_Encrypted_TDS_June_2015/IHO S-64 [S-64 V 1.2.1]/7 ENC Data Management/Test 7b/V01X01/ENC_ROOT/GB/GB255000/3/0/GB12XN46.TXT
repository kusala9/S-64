CURRENTS

The currents are complex and often strong. They are subject to large changes in 
speed and direction during the course of the year due to the seasonal reversals 
of the monsoon system of winds. Mariners are warned to watch for indications of 
abrupt changes in currents and to exercise due caution. Admiralty Sailing 
Directions should be consulted for further details.
