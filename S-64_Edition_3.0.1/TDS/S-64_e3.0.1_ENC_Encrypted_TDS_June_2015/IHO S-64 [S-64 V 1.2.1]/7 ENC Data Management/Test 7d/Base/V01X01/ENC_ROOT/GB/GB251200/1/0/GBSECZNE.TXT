SECURITY ZONES

An exclusion zone extends 2000 metres in all directions from the outer edge of
the terminal structure. Only tankers and support vessels authorised by the
terminal operator or Coalition maritime security forces are allowed to enter the
exclusion zone. Additionally, a warning zone extends 3000 metres in all
directions from the outer edge of each terminal structure. Vessels are advised
to remain clear of the warning zone for all but essential transits. If transit
requires entry into the warning zone, vessels are advised to contact the
Coalition maritime security forces via marine VHF channel 16.
