HIGH SPEED CRAFT 

High speed craft operate within this area. Mariners are advised to maintain a 
good lookout. Some high speed craft may generate large waves, which can have a 
serious impact on small craft and their moorings close to the shoreline and on 
shallow off-lying banks. For further details, see Annual Notice to Mariners No 
23.
