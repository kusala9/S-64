AREA OF SIMPLIFIED OR MINIMAL DEPICTION

Depiction of detail, including aids to navigation, has been simplified in
this area. This minimal depiction of detail does not support safe navigation,
therefore mariners should use a more appropriate navigational purpose,
supplemented by appropriate Admiralty publications.
