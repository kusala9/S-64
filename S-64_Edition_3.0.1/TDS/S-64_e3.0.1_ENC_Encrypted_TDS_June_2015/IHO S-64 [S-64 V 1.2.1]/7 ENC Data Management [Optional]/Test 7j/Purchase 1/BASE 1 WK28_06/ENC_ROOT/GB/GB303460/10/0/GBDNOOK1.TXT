FIRING PRACTICE AREA - DONNA NOOK

Although no restrictions are placed on the right to transit the firing practice 
area at any time, mariners are advised to exercise particular caution whilst in 
the area due to intensive military air activity conducted at low level. Red 
flags or red lights are displayed to indicate that the area is in use. The 
firing practice area is operated using a clear range procedure. Exercise and 
firing only take place within the surface danger area (marked by the Sea Danger 
Area Buoys - DZ Numbers 1-6 and the coast) when the area is considered to be 
clear of all shipping. For further details see Annual Notice to Mariners Number 
5, Byelaws, Practice and Exercise Areas (PEXA) charts and Admiralty Sailing 
Directions.
