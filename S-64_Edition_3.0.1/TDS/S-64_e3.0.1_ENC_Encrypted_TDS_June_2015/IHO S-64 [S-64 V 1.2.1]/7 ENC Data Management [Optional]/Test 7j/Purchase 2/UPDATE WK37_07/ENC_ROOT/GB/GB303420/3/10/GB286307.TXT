1. Lynn and Inner Dowsing Wind Farms are
currently being developed offshore, east of
Skegness. This will involve the installation of
wind turbines, each supported on a foundation
known as a monopile.

2. Submarine power cables will connect each
turbine to the next and then to the shore at
Skegness. Works for the installation of the
cables will take place between the Lynn Wind
Farm (53° 08´·15N., 0° 27´·55E.), the Inner
Dowsing Wind Farm (53° 11´·50N., 0° 26´·90E.)
and shore.
