GOOD UPDATE CELL

This directory contains one update cell for the new
edition of cell GB5x01sw.000.

The content is given below:

gb5x01sw.001	Replace 12.8m sounding at:

			32 31.75S, 60 56.85E

		with a 9.4m sounding. Modify the 10m
		contour to enclose.

		Because of the way that UKHO's ENC production
		software works, the update also deletes and re-creates a bundle of 		273 soundings as well as the 10m contour,
		the 5-10m depth area, the 10-20m depth
		area, a harbour area and a meta navigational system of marks.
