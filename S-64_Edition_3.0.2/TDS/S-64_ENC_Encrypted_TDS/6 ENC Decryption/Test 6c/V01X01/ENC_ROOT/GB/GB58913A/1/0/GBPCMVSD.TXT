PANAMA CANAL - MAXIMUM VESSEL SIZE AND DRAUGHT

The Canal authorities should be consulted for the latest
information on the maximum permitted size and draught of
vessels transiting the canal. Maximum draught depends to
some extent on the water level in Lago de Gatun which
varies with the seasons. For further information, see
Admiralty Sailing Directions.
