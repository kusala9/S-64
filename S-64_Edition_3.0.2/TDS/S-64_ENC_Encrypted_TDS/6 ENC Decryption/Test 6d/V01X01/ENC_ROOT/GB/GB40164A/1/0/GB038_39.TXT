FIRING PRACTICE AREA

Although no restrictions are placed on the right to transit the firing practice
area at any time, mariners are advised to exercise particular caution whilst in
the area. Red flags or red lights are displayed to indicate that the area is in
use. The firing practice area is operated using a clear range procedure.
Exercises and firing only take place when the area is considered to be clear of
all shipping. For further details see Annual Notice to Mariners Number 5 and
Practice and Exercise Areas (PEXA) charts.
