SUBMARINE CABLES

1. Submarine cables may conduct high voltages; contact with these poses an 
extreme danger and mariners may risk prosecution if damage is caused.
2. Anchoring or trawling within this area should be avoided. Seabed mobility may 
leave a cable spanning undulations and cause fishing gear to be irrecoverably 
snagged, putting a vessel in severe danger. If a cable is snagged, care must be 
taken not to sever it.
3. Some cables, particularly those installed since this edition was issued, may 
not be shown. For further information, see The Mariner's Handbook.
