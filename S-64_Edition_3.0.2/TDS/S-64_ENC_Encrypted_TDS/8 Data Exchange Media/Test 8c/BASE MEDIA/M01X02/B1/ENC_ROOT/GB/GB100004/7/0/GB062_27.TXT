WRECKS

Wrecks within 6 miles of the shore are omitted from this area. Seaward of this,
within the area of larger scale coverage, only wrecks with a depth of less than
15 metres are shown. No vessel should use this electronic chart to approach
within 6 miles of the shore, nor should it be used within the 100 metre line by
vessels with a draught exceeding 15 metres. Outside the area of larger scale
coverage, wrecks with known depths greater than 200 metres have been omitted.
