SUBMARINE VOLCANIC ACTIVITY - EXCLUSION ZONE

This exclusion zone, radius 0·81 miles, has been established around Kick'em
Jenny submarine volcano, due to the potential danger to shipping from volcanic
activity. Vessels should not enter this zone at any time. At times of increased
or dangerous volcanic activity an outer exclusion zone, radius 2·7 miles, may
be established by the local authorities. See Admiralty Sailing Directions for
further information.
