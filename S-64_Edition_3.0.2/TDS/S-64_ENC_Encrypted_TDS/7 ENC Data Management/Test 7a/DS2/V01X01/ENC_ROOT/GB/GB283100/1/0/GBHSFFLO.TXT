HIGH SPEED FERRIES

High speed ferries operate across the Florida Strait between Florida East Coast
Ports and the Bahamas. Mariners are cautioned that these craft move very rapidly
and may transit waterways at angles to the normal direction of traffic. Ferries
may deviate from published routes.
