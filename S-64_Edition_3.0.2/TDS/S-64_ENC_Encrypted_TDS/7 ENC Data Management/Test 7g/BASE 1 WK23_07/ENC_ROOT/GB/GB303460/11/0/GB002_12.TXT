OIL AND GAS FIELDS

Production platforms and associated structures, including tanker moorings, 
storage tankers and platforms on pipelines, generally exhibit Mo(U) lights, 
aircraft obstruction lights and audible fog signals. Unauthorized navigation is 
prohibited within 500 metres of all superstructures, including storage tankers 
which can swing about their moorings. Tankers manoeuvring in the vicinity of 
platforms and moorings should be given a wide berth. For further information see 
The Mariner's Handbook.
