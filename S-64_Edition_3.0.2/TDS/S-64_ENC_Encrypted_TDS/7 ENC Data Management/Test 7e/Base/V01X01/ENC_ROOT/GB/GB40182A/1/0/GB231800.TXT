2318(P)/99    MISCELLANEOUS - Dangerous and Non-dangerous wrecks - Depth 
criteria

1.  Mariners should be aware that many hydrographic offices, including the 
United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, use different depth criteria for dangerous 
and non-dangerous wrecks from those of the Chart Specifications of the 
International Hydrographic Organization, but the chart symbols used are the 
same. 
2.  The depth criteria adopted for use in Admiralty charts have changed over the 
years in response to the introduction of deeper-draught vessels and their safe 
navigation.  Admiralty Chart 5011, Edition 2 - 1998 (Symbols and Abbreviations 
used on Admiralty Charts), states the criteria in use for British Admiralty 
charts:
		

    Dangerous wreck (INT1 symbol IK28),		Wreck, depth unknown, which is 
considered dangerous to surface navigation		
						On modern Admiralty charts (post 1968), with 
the exception of those which have been produced initially by, or in co-operation 
with, other nations, this symbol is used when the depth over the wreck is 
thought to be 28 metres (15 fathoms) or less. For further details, see Note 
below IK29. 

    Non-dangerous wreck (INT1 symbol IK29),	Wreck, depth unknown, which is 
not considered dangerous to surface navigation		
						On modern Admiralty charts (post 1968), with 
the exception of those which have been produced initially by, or in co-operation 
with, other nations, this symbol is used when the depth over the wreck is 
thought to be more than 28 metres (15 fathoms).  For further details, see Note 
below.        

  						Note: On Admiralty charts published before 
1968, the depth criteria applied as follows:
            					before 1960    		8 fathoms
            					1960 to 1963    	10 fathoms
            					1963 to 1968    	11 fathoms
3.    Other hydrographic offices, from whose charts many Admiralty charts are 
derived or adopted, use various criteria for dangerous and non-dangerous wrecks; 
the depth used to distinguish  between dangerous and non-dangerous ranges 
between 18 metres and 30 metres.
      As a result, users of Admiralty charts should note that on some Admiralty 
charts, based on information from hydrographic offices which use different 
criteria, certain wrecks portrayed by symbol IK29 (insert symbol) may have 
significantly less water over them than the more than 28 metres (15 fathoms) 
indicated.
      For example, on an Admiralty chart of French waters, where the wreck data 
is taken from the French government charts, symbol IK29 (insert symbol) will 
indicate that more than 20 metres of water is thought to exist.
4.    Chart Specifications of the International Hydrographic Organization (MP-
004 Edition 1998) state:
	Specification 422.5	The term Dangerous wrecks is to be used (if 
unavoidable) for wrecks having, or likely to have, less than 20 metres of water 
over them in areas where such depths are dangerous to surface vessels capable of 
navigating in the vicinity.  Where the depth is unknown, the symbol IK28 may be 
used if no safe clearance depth can be estimated.
	Specification 422.6     The term Non-dangerous wrecks is to be used (if 
unavoidable) for wrecks having more than 20 metres of water over them.
				The symbol IK29 shall be used in waters over 200 metres 
deep, where a clearance depth cannot be indicated.  This term excluded foul 
ground, which is frequently the remains of a wreck and is a hazard only for 
anchoring or fishing.
5.    Chart Specifications 422.5 and 422.6 are due to be reviewed this year by 
the Chart Standardization Committee of the International Hydrographic 
Organization.  When the results of this review are known, the criteria for 
Admiralty charts will be re-assessed.
