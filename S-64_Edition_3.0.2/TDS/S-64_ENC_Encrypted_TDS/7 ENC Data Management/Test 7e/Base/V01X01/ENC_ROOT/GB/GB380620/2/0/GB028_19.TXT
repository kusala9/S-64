DEPTHS

This area has not been systematically surveyed. Depths are from miscellaneous
lines of passage soundings or old leadline surveys. Uncharted dangers may exist,
including coral heads, which may uncover, and are liable to exist anywhere
within the area of the fringing reefs. For further details see The Mariner's
Handbook which contains guidance on the interpretation of source data.
