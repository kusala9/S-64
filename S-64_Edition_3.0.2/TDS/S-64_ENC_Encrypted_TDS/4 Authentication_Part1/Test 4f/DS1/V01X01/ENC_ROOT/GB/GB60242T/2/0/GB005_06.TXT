HIGH SPEED CRAFT

High speed craft operate within this area. These craft may enter and leave the
fairway at speeds in excess of 6 knots. Mariners are advised to maintain a good
lookout. Some high speed craft may generate large waves, which can have a
serious impact on small craft and their moorings close to the shoreline and on
shallow off-lying banks. For further details, see Annual Notice to Mariners
Number 23.
