1. To maintain safety of navigation whilst permitting exploitation of the
continental shelf, the International Maritime Organization have approved an
extension to the ’Off Botney Ground’ TSS. These changes will be implemented at
0000 UTC 1 July 2007.

2. The existing TSS is to be extended 16 miles south-westwards along the Deep
Water Route via DR1 Lightbuoy. The extended scheme will terminate approximately
5 miles north-east of Inde Platform 49/24-N (53° 17´·29N., 2° 43´·30E.) and
7 miles north of Sean Platform 49/25A RD (53° 13´·52N., 2° 49´·54E.). Its
south-western end will be marked by a safewater buoy in position 53° 21´·10N.,
2° 50´·73E. The extended separation zone will run parallel to the existing
borders of the Deep Water Route allowing the extended lanes to retain their
current 1.4 nautical mile width.

3. These new amendments are shown in the accompanying diagram.
