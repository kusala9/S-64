OIL AND GAS FIELDS

Production platforms and associated structures, including tanker
moorings, storage tankers and platforms on pipelines, generally exhibit
Mo(U) lights, aircraft obstruction lights and audible fog signals.
Unauthorised navigation is prohibited within 500 metres of all such
structures, including storage tankers which can swing about their
moorings. Tankers manoeuvring in the vicinity of platforms and
moorings should be given a wide berth.
