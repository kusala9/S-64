DRAUGHT RESTRICTIONS

To reduce the risk to deep-draught vessels resulting from traffic congestion,
passage through Black Deep and Knock John Channel is normally restricted to
vessels with a draught of over six metres. Vessels with a draught of less than
six metres approaching from the south-east should normally use Princes Channel
unless access is limited by tidal or weather constraints. In these circumstances
clearance to use the Black Deep/Knock John Channel via Fisherman's Gat may be
sought through Port Control, London.
