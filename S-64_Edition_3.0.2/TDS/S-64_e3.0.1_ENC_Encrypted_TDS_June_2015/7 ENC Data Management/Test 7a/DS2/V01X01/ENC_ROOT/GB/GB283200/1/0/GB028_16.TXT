DEPTHS

Much of this area has not been systematically surveyed. Many depths are from
miscellaneous lines of passage soundings or old leadline surveys. Uncharted
shoals and patches of coral may exist. For further details, see The Mariner's
Handbook which contains guidance on the use of charts based on old surveys.
