CURRENTS

Throughout the year the Equatorial Current flows in a predominantly west to
north-westerly direction at mean rates of between 0·5 and 1 knot. The current
is more constant to the south of Jamaica than to the north and mean rates of
up to 2 knots can increasingly be expected in a south-westerly direction from
the island. Admiralty Sailing Directions should be consulted for further
detailed information.
