CURRENTS

The Florida Current, which flows northwards through the Straits of Florida,
tends to branch East over the Bahama Banks and into North West Providence
Channel. Particular caution should be exercised in this channel. Outside the
reefs north east of Great Abaco Island, the current runs to the North West or
South East, sometimes with considerable strength. It changes direction rapidly
and its maximum rate is about 3 knots. For further information see Admiralty
Sailing Directions.
