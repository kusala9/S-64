CURRENTS

Throughout the year the Equatorial Current flows on a
predominantly west to north-west direction off the south
coast of Haiti at mean rates of between 0.5 to 1 knot.
The Antilles Current flows south-westerly through the
Windward Passage at similar mean rates but the
prevailing weather conditions and coastal configuration
can result in variable direction. Counter-currents for
both current systems exist and may be experienced close
inshore. Admiralty Sailing Directions should be
consulted for further information.
