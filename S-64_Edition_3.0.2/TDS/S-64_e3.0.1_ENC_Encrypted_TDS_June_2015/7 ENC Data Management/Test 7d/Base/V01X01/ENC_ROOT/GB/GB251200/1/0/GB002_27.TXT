OIL AND GAS FIELDS

Production platforms and associated structures, including tanker moorings,
storage tankers and platforms on pipelines, generally exhibit Mo(U) lights,
aircraft obstruction lights and audible fog signals. Unauthorised navigation is
prohibited within 500 metres of all such structures, including storage tankers
which can swing about their moorings. Tankers manoeuvring in the vicinity of the
platforms and moorings should be given a wide berth. Other uncharted structures,
both lit and unlit and submerged installations, some marked by buoys, may exist.
For further information see the Mariner's Handbook. Additionally, and in
accordance with Saudi Seaports Authority Notices to Mariners, the majority of
oil and gas field field features have been omitted from this chart within the
Saudi Arabian EEZ. For further information on the charted RESTRICTED AREAS
around certain oilfields see the OIL AND GAS INSTALLATIONS note attached to the
areas.
