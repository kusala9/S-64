Charts (RNCs) from the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office's (UKHO) Admiralty 
Raster Chart Service (ARCS). The data may be used when type approving ECDIS 
systems operating in RCDS mode using either ARCS data or data from the Australian Hydrographic Service's Seafarer service, since both of these 
services use the same data format and encryption mechanism.<BR><BR>Because ARCS 
and Seafarer only use encrypted data within their services, the RNC data are 
also encrypted in a way that is compatible with both the ARCS and Seafarer 
services.</P>
<P>For ease of distribution, the test data is contained on a <a href="ARCS_HCRF_TDS.zip"> single ZIP
file</a> (47.5 Mb). However, 
to make the data conform to the HCRF specification, it must be split up into 
separate CDs before use. A total of ten (10) CDs are needed to hold the entire 
data set. Details for creating these CDs are provided with the test data 
set.</P>

<p>The ARCS-HCRF TDS package includes a <a href="RNC_HCRF.TXT"><b>readme file</b></a> which
must be read before proceeding with type-approving.</p>

<P>In the United States, all nautical charts produced by the Office of Coast 
Survey, NOAA, are available in a raster format. Official NOAA raster charts conform to 
the BSB File Format Specification.&nbsp;</P>
<P>A BSB File Format - Test Dataset Instructions for Raster Navigational 
Chart (RNC) has been produced to provide a description of the necessary checks 
and verification procedures required to properly use this type of data as a RNC. 
In conjunction with the development of this document, the BSB File 
Format Specification has been verified to be in compliance with the minimum 
requirements contained in the IHO Product Specification for RNC (IHO S-61). 
Similar to the United Kingdom's HCRF format used in ARCS, the BSB File 
Format is an official raster data that meets the requirements for 
the Raster Chart Display System (RCDS) mode-of-operation in ECDIS, as specified 
in Appendix 7 of the IMO Performance Standards for ECDIS. The BSB File 
Format Test Dataset Instructions for RNC also list the required checks/tests for 
RNC data to be used in conjunction with the RCDS mode of operation for ECDIS as 
described in IEC Publication 61174, 3rd Edition, Annex H.</P>
<P>The contents of the BSB File Format - Test Dataset Instructions for 
RNC include: - NOAA Chart #12221 (Chesapeake Bay Entrance) - Patch Updates 
(e.g., NTM, NCE, and CHT) - a ".pdf" file of paper nautical chart - supporting 
documentation (i.e., digital copy of the Test Dataset Instructions)</P>
<P>The BSB File Format - Test Dataset Instructions for RNC is a 
companion document to the publication entitled: BSB File 
Format, Version 3.0, Revision 3.07. This document is provided to companies who 
become licensed, Value-Added Developers (VADs) with NOAA. The BSB 
File Format - Test Dataset Instructions for RNC document is subject to the same 
terms and conditions that are required for VADs. As such, companies or 
organizations that intend to use the RNC Test Dataset Instructions should first 
have in place a BSB File Format VAD Agreement (license) with NOAA.</P>
