# IHO TEST DATA SETS FOR ECDIS
Publication S-64
Draft redline Edition 3.0.1 (June 2015)

## Introduction

The IHO Publication S-64 comprises an Instruction Manual and numerous data sets. Since the release of Edition 3.0.0, a number of minor clarification have been identified.  The 29th TSMAD meeting agreed that these should be included in a new Edition 3.0.1 of the document.  The draft new edition and associated test datasets can be downloaded below.

The S-64 data sets contain both encrypted and unencrypted ENC cells and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) data. Encrypted data sets conforming to the S-63 ENC standard (edition 1.1), have been included so that ECDIS data loading and management operations can be tested for conformance with IEC 61174. The unencrypted data sets have been included to further tests visualisation and operation aspects of the ECDIS. The RNC data sets conform to the Hydrographic Chart Raster Format (HCRF) and the Maptech BSB format.
