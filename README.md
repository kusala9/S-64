## Introduction

The IHO Publication S-64 comprises an test instruction manual and numerous test data sets. Since the release of Edition 3.0.0, a number of minor clarification have been identified.  

The S-64 data sets contain both encrypted and unencrypted ENC cells and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) data. Encrypted data sets conforming to the S-63 ENC standard (edition 1.2), have been included so that ECDIS data loading and management operations can be tested for conformance with IEC 61174. The unencrypted data sets have been included to further tests visualisation and operation aspects of the ECDIS. The RNC data sets conform to the Hydrographic Chart Raster Format (HCRF) and the Maptech BSB format.
